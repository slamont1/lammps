/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Invalid atom type in fix bond/create/dynamic command

Self-explanatory.

E: Invalid bond type in fix bond/create/dynamic command

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot use fix bond/create/dynamic with non-molecular systems

Only systems with bonds that can be changed can be used.  Atom_style
template does not qualify.

E: Inconsistent iparam/jparam values in fix bond/create/dynamic command

If itype and jtype are the same, then their maxbond and newtype
settings must also be the same.

E: Fix bond/create/dynamic cutoff is longer than pairwise cutoff

This is not allowed because bond creation is done using the
pairwise neighbor list.

E: Fix bond/create/dynamic angle type is invalid

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix bond/create/dynamic dihedral type is invalid

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix bond/create/dynamic improper type is invalid

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot yet use fix bond/create/dynamic with this improper style

This is a current restriction in LAMMPS.

E: Fix bond/create/dynamic needs ghost atoms from further away

This is because the fix needs to walk bonds to a certain distance to
acquire needed info, The comm_modify cutoff command can be used to
extend the communication range.

E: New bond exceeded bonds per atom in fix bond/create/dynamic

See the read_data command for info on setting the "extra bond per
atom" header value to allow for additional bonds to be formed.

E: New bond exceeded special list size in fix bond/create/dynamic

See the special_bonds extra command for info on how to leave space in
the special bonds list to allow for additional bonds to be formed.

E: Fix bond/create/dynamic induced too many angles/dihedrals/impropers per atom

See the read_data command for info on setting the "extra angle per
atom", etc header values to allow for additional angles, etc to be
formed.

E: Special list size exceeded in fix bond/create/dynamic

See the read_data command for info on setting the "extra special per
atom" header value to allow for additional special values to be
stored.

W: Fix bond/create/dynamic is used multiple times or with fix bond/break - may not work as expected

When using fix bond/create/dynamic multiple times or in combination with
fix bond/break, the individual fix instances do not share information
about changes they made at the same time step and thus it may result
in unexpected behavior.
